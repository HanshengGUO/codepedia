## Tech Stack
Codepedia is a full stack project with a primary focus on backend development. The technology stack used in this project is as follows:
### Front-end
* **Vue 3**, **TypeScript** and **Ant Design** are used to build the layout of website.
### Back-end
* **Java** & **Spring Boot** 2: The back-end is developed using Java and Spring Boot 2.
* Spring Boot Features: Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), interceptors, filters, asynchronous programming, scheduled tasks, and WebSocket are employed to enhance the functionality of the back-end.
* **Redis**: Redis is used as a cache to manage user login sessions and improve the performance of the application.
* **RabbitMQ**: RabbitMQ is utilized to decouple the "like" process, preventing excessive coupling that could lead to system crashes.
* **MyBatis** & **MySQL**: MyBatis, a powerful persistence framework, is used in combination with the MySQL database to store user and ebook data.
### Engineering Management
* Logging, Configuration Files, Hot Deployment, Git, Maven: These tools and practices are employed to manage the engineering aspects of the project efficiently.
* Unified Backend API Response Design, Encapsulated Unified Request Response Parameters, Utility Class Encapsulation: These techniques are used to streamline the development process and maintain a consistent codebase.
### Deployment
* Cloud Deployment: Codepedia is deployed on the cloud, leveraging cloud-based MySQL and Redis services for enhanced scalability and performance.
